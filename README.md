# ntsh

ntsh is an interactive tool for line-based protocols, such as HTTP
or SMTP. It can be thought of as a netcat that's better suited to
interactive use by a human. Features include an editable prompt,
history, and syntax highlighting, and asynchronous replies from
the server won't interfere with the prompt.

## Installation

ntsh is a pure-Python package, although Python 3.6 is required. To install,
unpack the source tarball (or pull from github), and in the source directory,
run `pip install .` (or `pip3 install .`, if that is the path for your Python
3-compatible `pip`).

## Usage

To connect to a remote host *host* on port *port*, run
```sh
ntsh host:port
```
This makes no assumptions about protocol. To specify a protocol, pass it with
`-p protocol[:options]`. At present the only supported protocol is
[katcp](https://katcp-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
